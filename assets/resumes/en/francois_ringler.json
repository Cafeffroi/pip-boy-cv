  "summary": "With 17 years of experience as a full-stack web developer, I have continuously evolved in the field of software development. My expertise lies primarily in back-end development, where I have worked exclusively with ASP.NET / .NET to build services and APIs. On the front-end side, I have developed versatility by exploring various technologies, including ASP.NET MVC and Angular.\n\nMy skill set also extends to user interface aspects, where I am comfortable with HTML and CSS, as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap and Material. In parallel, my database skills cover a range of solutions including MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.\n\nPassionate about the rapid evolution of technology, I have a growing interest in generative artificial intelligence, particularly models such as Claude.",
